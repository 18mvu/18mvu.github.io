                <p>Our story is that youâ€™re an,adventurer like Indiana Jones but sadly you do it for the money. You are given a job opportunity by a mysterious man and you have to take it otherwise you will die due to starvation and thus your story begins. 
The process of the game was mostly if and else statements but sometimes we would loop the answers so you could not break the game with inputting random text. <br>
How every answer has multiple endings and the story revolves around a temple with mysterious affects.<br>
Brandon's story about how Timmy is a happy boy that it's completely different because of the crazy storyline he has it was very funny and crazy endings.<br>
I would have a different storyline and would make it little longer and more detailed and lure the reader in.
